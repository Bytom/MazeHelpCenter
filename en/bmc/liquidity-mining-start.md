## BMC SuperTx liquidity mining start

The brand-new BMC sidechain of Bytom has been running stably for nearly three weeks. Some users registered BMC wallet and completed the asset mapping in the original Vapor sidechain. The SuperTx function of the BMC blockchain is also being restored for users to use.
Hereby, in order to encourage users to create BMC wallets to map original assets and become familiar with the SuperTx function of the new BMC sidechain, the Bytom holds the BMC SuperTx Liquidity Mining activity.

The activity will be for one month. During the period, users add BTM-BTMC or BTM-SUP pairs into the SuperTx pool, and the official will calculate the income on a daily basis, take snapshots from time to time every day, and distribute rewards to participating users once a week. A total of 400,000 BTM will be awarded for the activity.

### How to participate

1. Update to Bycoin 2.9.0 and creat a BMC address
2. If there are assets in the original Vapor sidechain, please wait for the asset mapping to be completed within 24 hours or use the cross-chain function or transfer function to recharge some assets
3. Enter the SuperTx liquidity pool, add the pairs into the pool, and the value must exceed 1000 BTM

|  Pair   | Proportion  |

| BTM-BTMC  | 50% |

4. After the addition is completed, the user will receive the activity income according to the following formula during the activity:
- Reward = Deposited / Current Total * Proportion * Total Reward* Asset 
- Deposited = Asset Quantity * Market Price at Daily Snapshot

5. The activity income is calculated on a daily basis, and snapshots are taken from time to time every day. The total reward for this activity is 400,000 BTM. The activity reward will be distributed to users who participate in this activity once a week. There are four cycles of the activity, and the total activity time is one month:
